-= THANKS GO TO =-

Steven Hugg (sehugg on Github), author and creator of 8bitworkshop.com,
whose responsively-reloading emulator paradigm directly inspired the
creation of Bobbin, and the --watch feature.

Seth Kushniryk <seth@kushniryk.com>, for contributing the 65C02 CPU and
Enhanced Apple //e support to Bobbin, along with performing a lot of
testing for it. Also for many tests and fixes for  graphical things in
the tty interface (though these were ultiately not included in Bobbin)

Kalus Dormann (Klaus2m5 on Github), for writing the exhaustive 6502 test
battery that was critically important to verify Bobbin's functionality

Adam Barnes (amb5l on GitHub), for porting Dormann's test battery to the
ca65 assembler.

Bruce Clark, for writing the BCD-specific 6502 tests.

Alain Mosnier <alain@wanamoon.net>, for creating the sha-256 module that
Bobbin uses to verify ROM checksums, and releasing it to the
public domain.

Will Scullin <scullin@scullinsteel.com>, author of the apple2js
emulator (https://www.scullinsteel.com/apple2//e)
The disk file-format-related code was of particular help to me in adding .nib
and .dsk support to Bobbin.

Andy McFadden <fadden@fadden.com>, author of CiderPress and
6502bench SourceGen. Andy's extremely useful hyperlinked disassemblies
at https://6502disassembly.com/ have been an indispensable
and constantly-at-my-side reference throughout all of my development for A2.

James Hall, who helped early on with testing and feedback
